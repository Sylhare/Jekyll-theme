***Hey there !***
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/myimages/dp2.jpg" alt="drawing" width="320px" height="320px" align = "left" style="padding:0px 0px"/>

I am Kaustubh. An undergrad second year CSE student at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I have worked in Android Development and I am currently exploring ML and Blockchain(yeah its clich√© ;) ).

<br/>
I have always had a keen interest in finding links between different fields from Biology to Mathematics, and from Vedic Literature to Modern Science which drive to always keep learning and be really open.

I am admirer of new small ideas and a wanderer in the clouds of dreams & poetry. By the way I prefer *cycle* to wander. :))

Happy to meet you friend !!!
