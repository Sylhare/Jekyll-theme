I'm very proud of my CV, and it's here for anyone to see. However, I'll distribute it only as a .pdf or .docx, just to slightly reduce the number of bots crawling it and taking my email address and phone number.

Before opening my CV, please note that I am not looking for roles at the moment. I'm always open to ideas and projects, but I'm not about to up sticks and move for an average job in a different city. Please consider this before contacting me.

[You can find a Word document (.docx) of my CV here.](/assets/cv/CV.docx)

Thank you for being interested; feel free to ping me any ideas or project plans you might have, but please don't cold call me or think that I'm up for working for free.
