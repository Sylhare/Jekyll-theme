The Marker's Apprentice was a marking system used at the University of Nottingham, developed by myself and my supervisor (Dr Colin Higgins).
It was responsible for assessing several thousand student coursework solutions in both the UK and China. It allows the management of courseworks and electronic submission via a webpage. The webpage communicates with a back-end server using Java RMI and reads a pre-defined set of marking 'tools'. Each tool has it's own configuration and is responsible for measuring functional correctness, code style (Using PMD), structure (Custom PMD rulesets). It provides highly customised results with details on how to fix mistakes and more importantly, why they are problematic. It gave links to further reading for any areas in which students lost marks. For some exercises, resubmissions were allowed to give the student an instant feedback loop (Submit, learn from results, submit again).

My supervisor and I wrote several publications on how it worked and the effectiveness of it; you can read some of them here:

For this work, as well as helping teach, I received a highly commended PGR Teaching Award in 2015.
