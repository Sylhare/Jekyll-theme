[Spindroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nutterzuk.spindroid&hl=en) was one of my first development projects. It is an Android fruit machine game which was downloaded by over 5,000 players and rated at 4 stars. It is available on the play store here:

Unfortunately, it is no longer maintained for phones with larger screens. The mobile app did win me the joint best dissertation in Computer Science, and was awarded an extraordinary school individual project prize from Nottingham University (https://nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/news/2012-prize-winners.aspx).

Tech stack:
- Android
- Built with Maven and unfortunately in Eclipse.
- PHP for high scores (before the days of Google Play highscores).
