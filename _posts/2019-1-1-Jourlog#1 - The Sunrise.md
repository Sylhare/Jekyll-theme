This is the my first blog of the series Jourlog, where I share my weekly learnings. I will try to continue this series through out the year.

# The Sunrise

As a new year resolution I have taken up to write a weekly Jourlog(Journal Blog) compiling my works and learnings.
I would also mention three rules that I have strictly followed during the week and will plan the new ones.

### Goals-de-Week :

GOAL                          | STATUS %
-------------                 | -------------
Intern Android Dev            | 0%
ML AndrewNg till Week 5       | 0%
***100 Hour Week-Work***      | 0%

### Rules-de-Week :
* ***First Things First -*** I must devote the starting 4 hours of the start of my day to weekly goals.
* ***Plan to Wake -*** You may wake on time but you need a preplanned morning to break the inertia.
* ***Practice Concentration -*** Will practice 7 hr of deep work daily using time blocking.
